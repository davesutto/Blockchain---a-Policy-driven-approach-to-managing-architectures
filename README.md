# Blockchain a Policy Driven Approach 
 A policy driven approach to development and selection of blockchain architectures



# **Introduction**

This paper describes a number of significant opportunities that were identified during a review of blockchain and its ability to support or benefit from Industry 4 technologies. The benefits accrue from the use of *Policy Directed Blockchain Architecture* (PDBA). A new term introduced to cover the opportunities described here. 

At the time of the review blockchain was being investigated by the major traditional architecture players such as Amazon, Google, Oracle, IBM, ICL and Baidu. Amazon, a major player in the IT and infrastructure services arena, have now announced their new AWS service BaaS (blockchain as a service). Blockchain on AWS is stated as reducing setup time by 60% and transaction throughput by 3 fold. As 25% of Ethereum nodes and 70+ validated blockchain partner solutions are on AWS marketplace, the service has market credibility.  Although the strategies of these players weren’t considered during the review, their strategic involvement was inevitable given the findings covered here. Given the scale and breadth of the opportunities there is room for both traditional players and blockchain players to develop solutions outside of the crypto currency market space. 

Opportunities fall into two broad categories: those that can be achieved by further development of blockchain architectures, while retaining core principles and policies; those that are achieved by adapting principles and policies to align with new business domains. This paper focuses on opportunities arising from adapting core principles or making radical changes to those principles.  

The key principles and policies we are looking at relate to the requirements for data to be secure, private, accurate, reliable, time dependent and managed. Also those relating to the differences between data, information and knowledge. In addition the principles underpinning the funding and payment models, built into blockchain architectures. The concept of performance and transaction throughput is also considered, as true performance (transaction life cycle) as seen by a user or an organisation unit can be very different from infrastructure performance.

The opportunities arise from the fact that principles and policies that apply to data in the financial sector and crypto currencies, don’t apply or have different prioritise within other business domains or technology domains. Blockchain has been developed with centralised finance in mind and a principle of very high security based on advanced cryptology and shared responsibility for validation and security. However, there is much more to the blockchain echo system that can be leveraged to support new areas, especially by reevaluating the priority of these fundamental principles. 

As this paper is looking at new opportunities for the use of blockchain, it isn’t looking to redesign or make fundamental changes to the structure and design, but rather at improving flexibility and agility based on aligning priorities with business goals. 

Industry 4 was chosen as a future time-frame for new advanced technologies and Society 5 as a reference point for community change. 

Industry 4 provides a number of reference technologies and systems that blockchain needs to work alongside. It also provides new opportunities for the use of blockchain. However, blockchain must evolve and resolve a number of key issues before this becomes feasible.  Reevaluating principles and policies is a valuable technique when developing new strategies of this scale. 

# **Principles and Policies**

Principles and Policies are used extensively in some businesses and are used in all areas from strategy through to infrastructure design. Others use them to a lesser extent or use alternative approaches. The key to their use here, is to adopt a less formal definition than is used by the more formal methodologies and be flexible in the approach. 

I tend to think of Principles being underpinned by Policies. A principle could be that transactions on a blockchain are as secure as possible or, in Logistics systems, details of an item being transported are as up-to-date and accurate as possible. The corresponding policies could be the use of POW for creating blocks or the use of a blockchain to ensure a single view of data. The logistics system may only require one of the less stringent POS approaches or PRO. It may also require a higher throughput (including validation) than is possible using POW. So if using PDBA, we would most likely chose a POS approach. Assuming the Logistics company also has a principle of only using well established technologies. 

Where the principles and policies, and PDBA are also used to support formal strategies, capability analysis or assurance reviews a more formal definition may be required. 

Where principles are used to support formal strategy development they tend to be prioritised. This could be a useful approach for those less familiar with defining principles. Priorities of principles tend to change over time as business priorities change. It is useful to prioritise principles. Gold, Blue and Green work for me, as Gold would tie into a companies Golden Threads (a thread that ties all vital activities).  

# Industry 4

Key elements of Industry 4 include:

The Gig Economy

Automation

Robotics

IoT

Analytics

Healthcare

Smart Cities

Blockchain

# Society 5

Society 5 is built on the core technologies described within Industry 4. Further opportunities can be identified by looking at society, rather than purely new advanced technologies. The focus here is the social changes and changes to society as a whole. Social change would look at new areas such as the Voluntary Sector and Community Sectors. Society would be looking at areas such as The Environment, Climate Change, Global Financial Models and Health Care.  Blockchain addresses the Financial Model to some degree but doesn’t consider the other major areas to any extent. 

# Current blockchain Problems and Issues

When looking at the area of Decentralised Finance, blockchain has serious problems to overcome with performance and transaction throughput. 
 A further issue is that although a higher level of security is provided than for traditional systems, the same isn’t true for privacy and it can be seen as an issue where very high levels of privacy are required.
A major issue with Crypto Currencies, new entrants and new architectures is determining which are technically viable, which have the capability to deliver, and which will survive. The same is true to a lesser extent for technical innovations and involvement in new areas such as Industry 4 technologies. Due to the crypto currency environment, its is far harder to evaluate blockchain than well established traditional architectures.   
When moving into new business domains having different principles and policies, the issue of evaluating the likelihood of success becomes more important and more difficult. This paper assumes that new and stronger development and evaluation methodologies are employed. These would typically include robust Capability Modelling, Independent or Community Assurance and Operability. A greater requirement for practical proof, in additional to theoretical modelling will also be required. It is unlikely that this can be achieved without greater community governance and responsibility.  
It is generally assumed that the major issue when moving to new business domains, is that blockchain was designed to support decentralised finance, rather than providing a general solution for decentralised systems. However, there additional significant challenges around the cultural differences and business priorities and strategies, underpinned by significantly different core principles and policies. 
It is proposed that by aligning Blockchain Principles and Policies with the strategic requirements of new domains, the problems and issues are far easier to solve and there are greater advantages to be gained by the use of blockchain in new arenas. 



# Proposal

This paper proposes that by resolving the performance issue inherent in the leading blockchain architectures and extending the services provided, blockchain will not only become a viable option beyond the financial sector, and specialised use cases, but become a core technology. This will require blockchain to align core principles and policies with those of the business domain in which it intends to operate.

# DAG Architecture

The review decided to use a developing architecture as a reference. The review did not verify the viability of this architecture or the developers capabilities. The theoretical functionality was taken as valid, rather than requiring concrete tangible proof. This was appropriate as research papers covered the detail behind core technologies and the aim was only to use a DAG architecture as a reference point.  No involvement from any company was requested, as this was an independent study. 

A DAG architecture was chosen as it has the foundations necessary to support a number of Industry 4 areas under investigation. A reference company was also chosen. Their strategy to move outside of the financial arena, with a focus on IoT was also seen as an ideal fit with the aims of the investigation. Monitoring and Control was also covered as it is a traditional business domain that fits well with the use of a DAG architecture. 

A key elements of the DAG architecture is that it supports parallelism which is beneficial in meeting the high transaction throughput necessary to approach traditional requirements. The consensus and validation strategy should also provide significant benefits (particularly in the area of IoT). Being a Level 1 architecture allows blockchains to be developed on top of it. It also provides a mechanism for integrating blockchains, which could be crucial when working in more complex business domains such as IoT.  The future possibility of running multiple blockchains, possibly with different schemas could be a game changer.  A further potential future option, that should be viable, is running a data channel alongside the core blockchains that caters for transactions that only need to be posted periodically. However, in addition to these well established and known areas of investigation, reevaluating principles has a far greater payback outside of the financial sector.  

It should be noted that other blockchains could have been chosen, however the business domains and technical areas involved would have been different.

# Review Process

All reviews were at a high level and only intended to provide a basis for further work and identify a suitable option for exploring potential strategies.  

Capability models were seen as a reasonable tool to support the reviews. They highlighted the scale of the capability gap that needs to be addressed. However, they also identified the potential value of extending beyond the current business domains. 

# Business Differentiators

Different business domains tend to have specific principles and policies which underpin their business and technology strategies. Operations businesses tend to differ from financial business in that they generally have a front and back office. The back office tend to include financial services, business management and IT. The front office tend to include services such as logistics and field management. Management and Control can be seen as a sector within a front office or as a different domain. Once we look at the Charity and Voluntary sectors we start to see very different priorities where conventional blockchain could fit. However, in the majority of cases, aligning priorities with blockchain principles would provide far greater benefits than attempting to fit generic blockchain models.  

The importance of Data, Information and Knowledge can vary considerably across domains. As can the importance of data: security, privacy, accuracy, completeness, reliability and time sequence. This can provide a challenge when adapting an infrastructure or system designed with financial services in mind. However, it can also provide the opportunity to overcome many of the problems associated with adopting financial principles and policies. 



# Security and Performance

Security and Performance are two of the least understood and most complex areas in IT. This is especially true when considering performance as viewed by a user or organisation unit, rather than an internal infrastructure component.  In some instances Blockchain can be viewed as being inherently faster than traditional architectures, due to its distributed structure, rather than vastly slower. However, this depends on the overall systems design and taking advantage of the distributed structure. The key is to consider performance from the position of an organisation unit, where the transaction should be considered in terms of its life cycle i.e. how long does it take for a transaction to be accessible by an organisation unit. 
In terms of security, the onion analogy works well: As opposed to fire walls where the out rings are key, with a blockchain the inner ring is the strongest. 
An aspect of security that has always dogged the IT industry is reliability. The issue is that different IT systems or applications can give different results as there is no single view of the Data or single definition (schema). Although reliability is often a trade-off against cost and effort, in some cases such as Transport it can become a serious issue. A single view of the Data or Information could overcome this problem. This is inherent in the structure of a blockchain. 
The key to determining which aspect of security or performance is key, is ensuring principles and policies align with the business domain and technology domain under consideration. 

# Data Principles and Policies

These include:
	Security  - From Loss, Damage, Modification, Unavailability 
	Performance – throughput, latency, infrastructure, organisation unit, access v update
	Privacy
	Reliability
	Accuracy
	Completeness
	Time sequenced
	Auditable
	Verifiable
	Managed
	Value alignment
	Stringent Funding and Payments

As the principles and policies differ across domains the trade off between cost, performance, data policy and functionality varies. For example in a financial system information is generally expected to be reliable. In other domains the cost of very high reliability can’t be justified and in others reliability is only achieved as transaction volumes increase. The question for blockchain designers is whether to design for financial services, undertake generic design or business specific design. An underpinning flexible blockchain architecture has significant benefits and market advantage. If we look at investment, funding and payment models that are built into the fabric of blockchain, there is no reason why one size should fit all, even on a core blockchain architecture. By adding a layer, new financial models can be added. Free to use services then become viable, as they would use a different funding model across their layer. 

By taking three of the most fundamental principles of blockchain and adapting them, far wider opportunities present themselves. These are the principles of security, retention of data on the blockchain and the funding model. By adopting a principle of appropriate security and appropriate data retention, plus tailored funding, new avenues open up. The rational for adopting blockchain now starts to evolve from one of very high security, towards a decentralised service that meets the requirements of the community. Functionality, reliability, availability, accessibility, easy of use, cost and funding now come more into play. By building these into existing blockchain architectures it is possible to increase value and open up new market opportunities. 
Data, Information and Knowledge

Within the financial domain transactions are often thought of as Data and principles and policies developed around this concept. The importance of differentiating between Data, Information and Knowledge becomes more significant in other Business Domains. Taking Monitoring and Control as an example, the security of knowledge could be an area for blockchain to provide a secure solution. It is unlikely that performance would be an issue in Use Cases involving knowledge. It should be noted that Knowledge capture, retention and transfer is becoming a crucial issue across many domains. Information is also a key issue for communities and businesses, as security can be more critical when dealing with information than when handling data or base transactions. The concept of information being derived directly from data, as in financial systems, can be purely theoretical and mask the real requirements for both Data and Information.  

# Implementation

The process of aligning business, systems and architecture principles and policies is a well understood process especially when developing strategies and undertaking strategic design. Adopting a simplified enterprise architecture approach, based on core principles and policies, is also well understood. 
In essence business systems and architecture principles and policies are defined and aligned with blockchain principles and policies. These are then reviewed against system and architecture features of blockchain to ascertain priorities and identify opportunities. This could also be undertaken as part of standard analysis and design. Ideally both would be undertaken.
From a blockchain selection and design perspective, we would be looking at:
	Blockchain structure
		level 1 or 2
		Architecture e.g. DAG 
		Support for high volume, less important transactions, off the main blockchain
		Support for multiple blockchains with different schemas and consensus
		Support for blockchain integration	
	Block creation and hash mechanisms (POW, POS, PRO)
	Consensus and validation mechanisms
	Database options for blockchain data access (including Hashgraph for timings)

# Conclusion

The use of flexible blockchain architectures that can be aligned with business domain principles and policies, would facilitate a number of strategic opportunities. For example:	

The opportunity to implement blockchain in new areas, including Industry 4 and Society 5.
The opportunity to replace existing architectures e.g. Transport and logistics 
Resolution of the performance issues associated with blockchain. Through both mitigation and adaption.
Resolution to long running issues with traditional architectures e.g. single view of data.
Opening up new business opportunities not viable with older blockchain architectures
Provision of holistic solutions that include the benefits of both worlds: well proven traditional architectures married with blockchain security and distributed architecture.
Development of decentralised, community owned and managed services that aren’t limited to blockchain functionality.
Development of turnkey, of-the-shelf decentralised services
Blockchain as a Service. Similar to System as a Service and Web as a Service
Integration of business specific blockchains
The ability to introduce free and open community services using new funding models
Blockchain acting as the glue that binds blockchain with traditional architectures
Facilitate the use of more stringent methods for assessing the likelihood of success when implementation major change programmes.  Including Independent Assurance, Operability and Capability Gap Analysis.

This model has been produced to illustrate how the top level capabilities of a Bockchain provider can be assessed. The aim is to assess the likelihood of achieving the required outcomes. This will enable an initial comparison between different providers, solutions integrators and participants to be made. 
It can be seen that policies play a key role in determining capabilities. They are also used, to some degree, when assessing other areas. 

A similar model can also be used by providers to help in determining which areas to focus on in order to enter new markets or strengthen existing ones.  Where more flexible blockchain architectures are being developed this approach is fundamental in targeting the most appropriate solutions. 

# Appendix 2 – PDBA within a major change programme

Where businesses undertake major change programmes that have significant IT involved they use methodologies (methods and practices) tailored to the size and scale of the programme and technologies involved. Larger businesses and those using major consultancies tend to not only mix and match methodologies but introduce new methods and tailor others. This is a good practice for anyone introducing new technology as off-the-shelf methods generally need tailoring to meet new requirements. Few methodologies include suitable processes around Independent Assurance, Operability and Policy Alinement is not generally covered, the nearest being Requirements Analysis and Proof of Concept.  

A practical method of introducing PDBA would be to develop simple processes and document the method. The method then needs to be integrated into an overall methodology. This is relatively straightforward. The difficult comes in ensuring its use and it becoming embedded into the change and development culture. The same is true for blockchain providers. Again this is relatively simple, as its a matter of advertising a new approach. A simple picture is useful. This will be seen whenever stakeholders gain access to their on-line work areas. Purely including it in a strategy or methods document or manual isn’t too effective unless you have rigid quality control. Please note Agile and Kanban are not classed as programme methodologies here, we are talking about the higher level methodologies within which they sit.  As the methods and processes around strategy and innovation tend to be pretty poor, this could be an opportunity to review them.
